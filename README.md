# SecondDX Web

SecondDX Web is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to provide an
engaging and supportive mental health experience. It combines advanced AI
technologies, a user-friendly interface, and secure backend infrastructure to
offer personalized mental health assistance and resources.

## Overview

The SecondDX Web project integrates three major components:

1. **Backend (Django)**:

   - The core backend is built with Django, providing a robust and scalable
     framework for managing users, chat functionalities, and AI-driven
     evaluations.
   - It uses Celery for asynchronous tasks, such as processing chat messages and
     analyzing user interactions.
   - RESTful APIs are powered by Django Rest Framework (DRF), enabling seamless
     communication between the backend and other components.

2. **Frontend (ReactJS)**:

   - A dynamic and interactive web application is implemented using ReactJS,
     offering users an intuitive experience.
   - ReactJS is used to deliver a multi-page application (MPA) architecture,
     combining traditional Django templates with modern frontend capabilities.
   - Features include real-time chat interfaces, user profile management, and
     data visualizations.

3. **Mobile Application (React Native)** _(In Progress)_:
   - A mobile version of the platform is under development to extend SecondDX's
     accessibility to iOS and Android devices.
   - The mobile app will mirror the web functionality, providing a seamless user
     experience across platforms.

- A single backend serves both web and mobile clients, ensuring consistency and
  reducing redundancy.

### Secure and Scalable Infrastructure

- Secure user authentication with Django's robust user management.
- Support for OAuth-based authentication and tokenized API access.
- Scalable task processing with Celery and Redis, ensuring fast and reliable
  performance.

## Future Goals

  predictive mental health analytics and crisis intervention.
- **Community Support**: Enable group chat and peer-support systems.
- **Data Insights**: Provide visualized mental health trends and insights for
  users to track their progress.
